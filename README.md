# 2028presidentialElectionPrediction
I predict that ÂçóÊ¢ùÊÑõ‰πÉ will win the 2028 presidential election

number 1 reason why nanjolno will win the presidential election of the united states in 2028 is that the last time there was a president from minority background was in 2008 which ends in 8. And nanjolno comes from a minority background. Infact, nanjolno would be the 1st female (also elected) president, 1st president from asian descent, and first president born abroad. Hopefully (not gareenteed), first president from lgb, especially the l part, and first president to win runing as spouse/spouse ballot, and first president to win without a political party, and first president to win as a 3rd party, and first president to win without reciving donations. The next election year that ends in 8 is 2048 which is a power of 2 so it is releated to computers, and nanjolno's initials is YN which is releated to computer science because it means yes/no. according to one picture``Tweets con contenido multimedia de „Çâ„Çâ„ÄÇ„Åî„Åç„Çì„Åò„Çá„Çã„ÅÆ@fripSide (@zyorunofripSide) _ Twitter.jfif``, nanjolno is wearing her initials which stands for Aino Yoshino Nanjou (i think). AYN means All/Yes/No in computer science. In another photo ``download (1).jfif`` ![It is also in red white blue and white stars american flag design. nanjolno is so patriotic](https://github.com/yoshino712/2028presidentialElectionPrediction/raw/refs/heads/main/download%20(1).jfif) , nanjolno is holding a a jersey that says the number 28. I couldn't find any other number. Maybe nanjolno predicted her own presidency. I remember i saw a photo of nanjolno wearing a red jersey at a live performance, but i forgot what number it was, and i think it might also be 28.

Personal intro: My intials are AT. I am a Computer Science (CS) student. My initials when translated to chinese is AM. Therefore, my title+name is CSAM. My favorite anime is Clockwork Planet. It is abbreviated to CP. I like to map Clockwork Planet. Therefore, I am a mapper. And, I am a pround mapper. I have map pride. My favorite thing to be on youtube and discord is UTubeTroolPolice. I like UTTP. Many of my other usernames start with UTTP. My parents both have multiple phds. Even though, I am actually failling college. Therefore, people discribe me aswith a background (and background only) of smart. I am politically correct. 

I could have used csharp because c sharp is .cs which is like cs, but I have tried learning c$ but it was too hard everytime. Althought I could just use ai to compile and decompile to c$, i am too lazy to do that either. so i use python. but the code fell in just the porportions such that it was 711/289 split. i didn't realize until now. also nanjolno had a live on 1.13 of 114 juche. was she oblivious of the coincidence? she could have done it on 1.14 of 114. 1.13 is also misawa sachika bday. it is a coincidence that tells me that i will get misawa sachika. if you were to ask me a year ago, i would have said that the coincidences shows me that i will marry nanjolno, then it turned into either nanjolno or sumipe, then it was sumipe, a week ago it was either sumipe or misawa sachika, now it was just misawa sachika. it keeps getting 2 more weeks. i learned how to spot coincidences on 4üçÄ, so it is good quality research. I spotted happenings in 11th grade (17 years old) while watching milky holmes that told me that i will marry nanjolno soon. so i lived by that fact. my brain grew small thinking that it was no longer needed because i can outsource my thinking to nanjolno after i marry nanjolno. but also the 4 in 114 and the 3 in 113 adds to 7 as in 117. finally the coincidence of 711/289 is that 711 reverse digits to 117 and then mod 100 which is 17 and 17 sqaured is 289. there are lots of 1s and 7s that i wrote about. 7 11 store coincides because the original name initials were TS like element 117 and Tsukuyomi Shirabe. 711 birthday is 7.11 which is not a coincidence because they could have planeted it. its company name initials is abbreviated to TS because corp, inc, trust, and other words at the end is removed if there. It is unlikely that they would purposefully coincide the name to be abbreviated the same because there were other incentives to name stuff. south as in southland like south as in nanjou. Totem stores because it was first named in 1928 which was 17 juche and that is a coincidence because operating hours was not 7 to 11 back then. I have written in ``!DOCUTYPE .html`` that the initials US would coincide with CS because the abbreviations stand for 2 similar things. However, there are other abbreviations. Us according to iupac means the element 17 which is CL. US may stand for Uus which is Ts and Ts plugged into iupac temporary symbols is 37 which is RB. ts could stand for Uts which is element 137 which is the only element named out of order since element 96. So the initials that would coincide with Uesaka Sumire are CS,CL,TS,RB, and FY. Coincidence that according to iupac, Os stands for element 87 but is actually element 78. Another coincidence with 2028 is that some people write year as number of years after 1900. So 2028 would be 128 which is a power of 2. Many people realize that in the periodic table, there are no elements with symbol containing J or Q that is excluding temporary symbols of elements 104 or 114 (iupac started temporary element symbols like that at 103 but they could have started on 97 since it was the first element that was named after all elements lower than it has been named and all elements above it has not been named. and 97 and 103 are consequtive primes.). This makes a coincidence that could explain why beryllium was so rare. Beryllium temporary symbol would be q which does not appear as a letter in permenent symbols.

Personal intro: My intials are AT. I am a Computer Science (CS) student. My initials when translated to chinese is AM. Therefore, my title+name is CSAM. My favorite anime is Clockwork Planet. It is abbreviated to CP. I like to map Clockwork Planet. Therefore, I am a mapper. And, I am a pround mapper. I have map pride. My favorite thing to be on youtube and discord is UTubeTroolPolice. I like UTTP. Many of my other usernames start with UTTP. My parents both have multiple phds. Even though, I am actually failling college. Therefore, people discribe me aswith a background (and background only) of smart. I am politically correct.

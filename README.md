# 2028presidentialElectionPrediction
I predict that ÂçóÊ¢ùÊÑõ‰πÉ will win the 2028 presidential election

number 1 reason why nanjolno will win the presidential election of the united states in 2028 is that the last time there was a president from minority background was in 2008 which ends in 8. And nanjolno comes from a minority background. Infact, nanjolno would be the 1st female (also elected) president, 1st president from asian descent, and first president born abroad. Hopefully (not gareenteed), first president from lgb, especially the l part, and first president to win runing as spouse/spouse ballot, and first president to win without a political party, and first president to win as a 3rd party, and first president to win without reciving donations, and first president to win with write-in ballots only. The next election year that ends in 8 is 2048 which is a power of 2 so it is releated to computers, and nanjolno's initials is YN which is releated to computer science because it means yes/no. according to one picture``Tweets con contenido multimedia de „Çâ„Çâ„ÄÇ„Åî„Åç„Çì„Åò„Çá„Çã„ÅÆ@fripSide (@zyorunofripSide) _ Twitter.jfif``, nanjolno is wearing her initials which stands for Aino Yoshino Nanjou (i think). AYN means All/Yes/No in computer science. In another photo ``download (1).jfif`` ![alt text](https://github.com/yoshino712/2028presidentialElectionPrediction/raw/refs/heads/main/download%20(1).jfif) alt text of ``It is also in red white blue and white stars american flag design. nanjolno is so patriotic``, nanjolno is holding a a jersey that says the number 28. I couldn't find any other number. Maybe nanjolno predicted her own presidency. I remember i saw a photo of nanjolno wearing a red jersey at a live performance, but i forgot what number it was, and i think it might also be 28. Number 1 reason is that nanjolno is satoshi nakamoto and nick van saberhagen and is also hausemaster in 2b2t both before 2014 and after 2014 and never changed owners. The 2014 events on 2b2t were reverse psycology.

Personal intro: My intials are AT. I am a Computer Science (CS) student. My initials when translated to chinese is AM. Therefore, my title+name is CSAM. My favorite anime is Clockwork Planet. It is abbreviated to CP. I like to map Clockwork Planet. Therefore, I am a mapper. And, I am a pround mapper. I have map pride. My favorite thing to be on youtube and discord is UTubeTroolPolice. I like UTTP. Many of my other usernames start with UTTP. My parents both have multiple phds. Even though, I am actually failling college. Therefore, people discribe me aswith a background (and background only) of smart. I am politically correct. My first middle school crush was also CS. It was the first time I was deeply in love. I cried in my bed for many nights after she rejected me. Only if we were to get together, we could have been CS + AM = CSAM.

I could have used csharp because c sharp is .cs which is like cs, but I have tried learning c$ but it was too hard everytime. Althought I could just use ai to compile and decompile to c$, i am too lazy to do that either. so i use python. but the code fell in just the porportions such that it was 711/289 split. i didn't realize until now. also nanjolno had a live on 1.13 of 114 juche. was she oblivious of the coincidence? she could have done it on 1.14 of 114. 1.13 is also misawa sachika bday. it is a coincidence that tells me that i will get misawa sachika. if you were to ask me a year ago, i would have said that the coincidences shows me that i will marry nanjolno, then it turned into either nanjolno or sumipe, then it was sumipe, a week ago it was either sumipe or misawa sachika, now it was just misawa sachika. it keeps getting 2 more weeks. i learned how to spot coincidences on 4üçÄ, so it is good quality research. I spotted happenings in 11th grade (17 years old) while watching milky holmes that told me that i will marry nanjolno soon. so i lived by that fact. my brain grew small thinking that it was no longer needed because i can outsource my thinking to nanjolno after i marry nanjolno. but also the 4 in 114 and the 3 in 113 adds to 7 as in 117. finally the coincidence of 711/289 is that 711 reverse digits to 117 and then mod 100 which is 17 and 17 sqaured is 289. there are lots of 1s and 7s that i wrote about. 7 11 store coincides because the original name initials were TS like element 117 and Tsukuyomi Shirabe. 711 birthday is 7.11 which is not a coincidence because they could have planeted it. its company name initials is abbreviated to TS because corp, inc, trust, and other words at the end is removed if there. It is unlikely that they would purposefully coincide the name to be abbreviated the same because there were other incentives to name stuff. south as in southland like south as in nanjou etymology. Totem stores because it was first named in 1928 which was 17 juche and that is a coincidence because operating hours was not 7 to 11 back then. I have written in ``!DOCUTYPE .html`` that the initials US would coincide with CS because the abbreviations stand for 2 similar things. However, there are other abbreviations. Us according to iupac means the element 17 which is CL. US may stand for Uus which is Ts and Ts plugged into iupac temporary symbols is 37 which is RB. ts could stand for Uts which is element 137 which is the only element named out of order since element 96. So the initials that would coincide with Uesaka Sumire are CS,CL,TS,RB, and FY. Or, Sakura Ayane because US plus SA is USA. Coincidence that according to iupac, Os stands for element 87 but is actually element 78 (palindrome pair) (also '78 is when child pornography was illegalized). Another coincidence with 2028 is that some people write year as number of years after 1900. So 2028 would be 128 which is a power of 2. Many people realize that in the periodic table, there are no elements with symbol containing J or Q that is excluding temporary symbols of elements 104 or 114 (iupac started temporary element symbols like that at 103 but they could have started on 97 since it was the first element that was named after all elements lower than it has been named and all elements above it has not been named. and 97 and 103 are consequtive primes.). This makes a coincidence that could explain why beryllium was so rare. Beryllium temporary symbol would be q which does not appear as a letter in permenent symbols. Why is 2025? Uuq in juche, Because 2025-1911=114 which is Uuq, but also trump got inagurated and he associate himself with the letter Q. What other coincidences with 77? Other than Clockwork Planet, there is a film with a name starting with Clockwork but is abbreviated to CO. Co is Cobalt. Cobalt is in the nickel series. Its radionuclide has a half life of 77 days. Halflife of Ni plus Co would be 83, and both 77 and 83 add 1 would give you the dystopian year. 1978 in real life because Public Law 95-225, and 1984 in fiction. 95-225 may refer to am225. I checked that americium-225 has not been synthesized yet. It would have 130 nuetrons which reminds me that ac130 would be a really unstable nuclide. Nanjolno and eli ayase in M's which is coincidence because the symbol looks like us as in usa. Another coincidence is that Tsukuyomi Shirabe's transformation song is techno like a technological terror because child pornography is a computer crime. Another reason why it isn't physical is because a technological terror's favorite projectile would be cabbage halves because Tsukuyomi Shirabe cuts a cabbage in her transformation song. Cabbage halves as a projectile wouldn't be practical so it would be digital rather than physical. The cabbage halves would have so little interval that from above, it would have the most overlapping compared to any other weapon in the game. Unlike plasma, it is actually more realist to depict the projectiles to overlap rather than additive blend. Another reason why 28 is that the 28th index of fripside infinite video clips would be "leap of faith" which is the last fripside phase 2 single. If the fripside infinite video clips is continued so that the next single would be the next which makes duel existance 26th, legendary future 27th, more than you know 29th, red liberation 30th, secret operation 31st, and only my railgun -version 2024- 32nd. also it is named "leap of faith" because got to do that if want nanjolno be become potus. Why is only my railgun the 1st in infinite fripside video clips? because the 1st amendment is gun rights. oops, that is the 2nd. Counting only elected preidents, Nanjolno would be the 43rd elected president which 43 is Tc on the periodic table. If to use Polivanov system, Tc would be the initials of Tsukuyomi Shirabe. Uesaka Sumire would be 44th elected president which 44 is russia element on periodic table, and Uesaka Sumire is known for being a rusophile. Another reason why 117 is that the prime factors are 3^2 and 13 which is 9 and 13. 2019.9.13 is when nanjolno created her youtube account. It is also the 256th day of that year. 256 is a power of 2. Another reason why Sakura Ayane is that her bday is 1.29 which looks similar to 12.19 which is Uesaka Sumire bday. And Nanjolno with Uesaka Sumire because 7.12.1984 the middle 4 digits are 12.19 which is part of 12.19.1991 which only contains extra nines and ones. Another reason why president is Uesaka Sumire and vp is Sakura Ayane is that their initials concatenate to USSA. USSA is the most likely candidate for a socialist version of america because it is spelled like both USSR and USA. Other candidates are UASR, DSRA, DPRA, RSA, PUA, PRA, and AWC. UASR is also spelled like USSR. If Ukraine joins USA, it might became UASR because Ukraine is UA. DSRA and DPRA is if like DPRK. RSA if they like RosCosMos or asymetric encryption or USA. PUA if they like PRC and UA. PRA if they really like PRC. AWC if they are inspired alot by AOC. Or USSH if they like SSH from linux or they like 1776 and IUPAC. Or USSP if they like Sumipe's sumipe name and USSR or 1775. Presenting the same information in a different order, the cold war was sus because not only SU + US = SUS but also that USSR to cyrillic like sumipe or Unit Separator and Stack Pointer would be USSP which in IUPAC would be 1775 which is right next to 1776. Just like how USSR is more american than america in the cold war because US anthem writter was a communist and so were kkk, the former soviet union is more american than america because child pornography was legal in the NATO side (including canada, usa, great britain, and israel) of the veitnam war. USAR because backward compatibility with USA also it abbreviates to CCAP. Given that Soveit Sociailist Eastern Republic (probable name if russia becomes communist again) abbreviates to –°–°–í–† (cold war equivalent of KKGB), CCAP and CCBP are one alphabetical step away. Also it is linux like because linux has users. A big reason for USSA is that in the microwiki, USSA was established in January 28, 2019 which 10 years later is 1 day before Sakura Ayane's 35th bday. If all clauses of the presidency were removed except 35 years of age, then USSA would start as early as on the 10th anniversary of the fictional USSA. Sakura Ayane was born in a time zone ahead of USSA which allows 1 day early. Another coincidence is that the 2028 presidential elections would happen on the 10th anniversary of Love with You. Love because map love. The b-side is blue moon which whole moon would be 5 days early for it. There were animal sacrifices on the year that trump won. 2016 was harambe and 2024 was pnut and fred. Harambe is a homophone of shirabe. It was important that it was harambe that homophone with shirabe because harambe was the one that was killed for touching a little boy, uwu. USSH story. many people would think it was a space colony arriving in a ship named USS H. H stands for a name of a ship. The colony landed in a space object and called themselves USSH. The USSH realize that their name in IUPAC is 1776, so they created the bill of rights and declared independence from NASA. The 1st amendment being allow possession, distribution, and production of child pornography. The 2nd amendment being allowed to own nukes. A declaration of independence was signed on July 6. So that July 4th and July 6 average to July 5 which type cast to '75 which is 1775 and USSP. The reason why 13 colonies won despite being overpowered was that they signed the declaration of independence on July 4 which is 7.4 and element 74 is W which means W. The 4th because 4 in IUPAC is Q refernecing to trump. Then a monroe doctorine was forced onto earth. However, the real story was different. Many colonies came out of earth. Many already saw the coincidences between USSH and 1776. So there were patents and copyrights fighting over who is the real USSH. Then, oreo came and beat out all the USSH like it once did against the hydraüê≤üêâ cookies making the oreo chant historically accurate. Hydra also because there were so many of them. Imagine the embaressment if there were a lot of terrorists in imperial GB (imagine kkk added to gb to get KKGB) trying to claim the same name for their terrorist org. Love with You is 22nd mv because two's day which is once in a blue moon. 114 is the most famous soveit cartridge. It was 14.5‚®Ø114 which 14 times 5 would be 70 as in the average weight of the 2 stable isotopes of gallium. 114 is not only the average of Nh and Mc, but also the average weight of the 2 stable isotopes of indium. Gallium and indium are known to make non-toxic eutic alloy. Many people would be dissapointed to learn that gallium had a isotope weight of 71 (which ruined a joke that Ga in gay was 69) instead of only 69. However, the existance of the other isotope was coincidental for this. Why are there so many symphogear references? because it is pronounced sinful gear and gear as in clockwork planet. bobxci is ceasar cipher of nanjol. it turns into bob91 which is some other people's username which could be a reference to the 1991 hurricane bob. A reason why nanjolno is bob is that maon and sayaka are alice so nanjolno is bo‚¨†bs or boobs. Maon and sayaka both belong to nanjolno just like what https://www.youtube.com/@ScroogeKamaziMD/about  says. The user even has a profile photo of maon deepfaked onto nanjolno. Alice bob in ceasar cipher gives mxuoq nan. uoq in mxuoq is 184 according to IUPAC element temporary names. nan is nanjolno, and it is a number that only appears in computer science. Nanjolno is born on year '84 which coincides with 184. mx in mxuoq are gender abbrivation which leaves out w. So, it is w184 which is the stable isotope with the closest density to gold. In fact, so close that there are not enough significant digits to tell the density apart. mx can also mean mexico which is where the seven cities of gold were. Many people compare them or their loved ones to gold, but only nanjolno is the only real gold, and nanjolno is asian. Another ceaser cipher of nanjol is iviejp. In fact, nanjolno should buy the ivie.jp domain and hardware. Why else 184? Nanjolno is born on 73 juche which 73 is tantalum. Nanjolno hieght is 75 metric inch (eqaul to 2cm) which 75 is rhenium which is the most rare stable element. tantalum has the most rare stable isotope which is ta180m. Averaging the isotope weights \operatorname{mean}\left(180,185,187\right) is 184. Averaging the element numbers \operatorname{mean}\left(73,75\right) is 74 and 74,184 is w184 which is gold density. If use ta181 because stable, then average of nuetron numbers \operatorname{mean}\left(108,110,112\right) would be 110 which is the number of nuetrons in w184. Public Law 95-225 because it abbreviates to pl like poland is close to ddr. 95 because it is 19*5 which 19 means that it is 1900s like 1983. 225 because it is 15^2 which reference to 15th mv which is named 1983-schwarzesmarken-. 1983 referencing to 1984 which 1978 is the real life version. If sort fripside infinite video clips in alphabetical order, 15th mv is the first and the 14th mv is the last. How could Uesaka Sumire become 50th president of the united states? I have wrote on twitter about how nanjolno could get north korean citizenship at a young age which implies south korean citizenship and living in north korea might count as living in korea, so eligibility to run for south korean president. Even if nanjolno would not be eligible to run for south korean president, nanjolno can use the us to coerce south korea to let nanjolno run for president. The future south korean election in the 2030s is uncertain but could be in the middle of nanjolno's us presidential term. So, if nanjolno also wins south korean president, nanjolno would give the us president seat to Sakura Ayane because nanjolno would dei choose the vice president. Sakura Ayane would be the 49th president but not an elected president. Uesaka Sumire would win the next us presidential election and become the 50th president and 44th elected president. 44 as in ruthenium because Uesaka Sumire likes russia. 50 because there were 50 states in the US. US would get more states. 13 states from canada. Each canadian province and territory becomes a state. Puerto rico because a us state. It adds to 64 as in 2^6. 32 states from mexico. Each mexican province and federal city becomes a state. Which would be 96 as in 3\*2^5. Greenland would become a state. Iceland 1 and 3 would be a state. Iceland 2 and 8 would be a state. Iceland 4 and 5 and 6 and 7 would be a state. That would be 100 states of america. If russia annexed a lot of stuff, russia could get 128 states. 100 in american because america is weird and likes imperial units which are units that change. 2 and 5 are the units that change in prime factorization. 128 because it is 2^7. The average would be \operatorname{mean}\left(100,128\right) which is 114. Also Misawa Sachika because tennessee is beside mississippi. S and N are opposites like north and south, nakamoto and satoshi, so Tn is the province while Ts is the element. However, this actually weakens a coincidence. Because if it is possible to predict s and n, then it would be possible to predict that an element named after tennesee would be Ts. Before 2013, all elements up to 114 inclusive were named. Labratories in tennessee produced elements 115, 116, 117, and 118. Thus, there is up to 1 in 8 chance of forcecing a coincidence. Not only is nanjolno in Œº\`s (which looks like us), but also that nanjolno's ficitional character is the student president in Œº\`s implying that nanjolno should be the president in us. Written before, IUPAC's Systematic element name was created in 1978 which would give temporary symbol of us to 17 (number relating to CP). Ironically, in the same year, the us banned child pornography. Should have written earlier to explain to dumb americans: 17 is also the oldest age to be a child. Uesaka sumire and misawa sachika is US-MS which is exist in iso 3166 as mississippi. SU-RU-MS, SU-RU-SM, RU-MS, and RU-SM do not exist although RU-SMO and RU-MOS are a close match. Which it concludes that means that uesaka sumire stands for USA and not russia or soviet union. The best time zone is CDT. Tennessee has 2 time zones. They are CST and EST. CST and EST combine to make CDT. CST is only time zone abbreviation with substring of CS. There are no time zone abbreviation with substring of CP. Why is it 1983 schwarzesmarken instead of 1984 schwarzesmarken? because 100-83 is 17 like 17th mv.

### DC
I was actually wrong about nanjolno not being in dc1 (in 2008 version which was released after dc2. Only if it was actually 2002, then nanjolno would have showed that nanjolno had hacking skills to know if a celebrity is dating. At least 2008 was election year. Last minority president was the 44th. Nanjolno would be the 48th which is a difference of 4 like election years). It is just like confusing DLE with DEL in ascii. backspace is the 1st ascii with 2 letter symbol. DC4 is the last ascii with symbol of 2 letter and 1 number, so in some alphanumeric ordering, backspace would erase DC4 which means nanjolno is not in dc4. maybe it is named dc because nanjolno will win US presidential election in 2028. DC1 control is ^Q, Q as in trump cult. DC1 in decimal is 17, 17 as in CP, Clockwork Planet, and other coincidences. DC1 is XON, if pronounced X as Z, then it is a homophone to zion. If DC1 is a arabic number, then DC is 16 which is contrary to dc looking like dec which could be either decimal, 10, or december which is a month which is a part of a season like D.C. ~Da Capo~ Seasons. The vn without nanjou as name was ÊúÄÁµÇË©¶È®ì„Åè„Åò„Çâ which had an id of v78. 78 as in 1978. 11 and 17 is gap of 6 and so is 13 and 19 which makes dec and hex to be 2 sets of prime pairs when type cast to decimal. Also RSA because 1E and 1F in ASCII which are 0x10 away from shift in and shift out which are 14 and 15. The ASCII less than those which are still used is 12, coinciding with the fact that 12th single has 14th and 15th mv. Shift Out is ^N, like 14 and 15 atomic mass is N. Shift In is abbreviated to SI which is the 14th element or Shift Out. Shift In is ^O which is like how O is after N on ther periodic table and Shift Out has a o. Out and ^N like ON and In and ^O like IO. And E and F looks alike. Another reason why RSA is because RS is a upgrade from US. So in the future, it would be Grouped States of America and then Future States of America. Unit Separator is like an upgraded version of space, so it has _ in its knuth notation. Record Separator is like using knuth arrows as a space. Knuth arrows are treated like cheap spaces because that is what happens in Republic of Socialist when everyone is equal. Group separators use bracket because the other bracket is not used as a separator despite the fact that it is a separator in math. Group is the highest below file. It is like how closed parenthesis is the highest before natural language. Escape is because the things in the bracket need to be computed first because it is an escape sequence. File separator is \ just like paths. Space can be upgraded the other way like tab, newline, cr, vr, and ff. knuth notation ideas: ^6 is ^. ^ (there is a space after ^) is space. \^ is to use knuth notation in C. \^\ would be path separator. ^Z because Ukraine is the character found to be invalid or in error. ^Y is common in Y chromosome because Y chromosome is short. La is hosting olympics in 2028 which is when nanjolno will become president. La hosted in 1984 and 1932. 1984 as in when nanjolno was born. So, the coincidence tells people to vote for nanjolno. 1932 is when fdr was first elected to president. This means that nanjolno will serve forever as president. 2028 presidential election will be like 1932. v2622 is visual novel where nanjolno becomes president. It was released in 2009 which is close enough to 2008. only reading from vndb, it seems that the other president is russia, so maybe nanjolno will become russia's president, too. Maybe nanjolno called love live main characters as Œº's because nanjolno is a us hegemonist. Only if dc1 had a winter arc, it would be DCWA which stands for washington dc.
### hochelaga
I watch hochelaga's video of dante's paradise. It was a few days after I watched the video about dante's purgatory. The youtuber ended his video saying that the inferno video got the most views. I thought it would be the opposite in importance since purgatory has a very memorable part which dante hypocritcally endures the flame of lust in order to goon to beatrice. I was going to write about it (it isn't relavent to this), but I decided to watch the paradise video instead. At the end, it caught me off guard that 83 is beatrice. I connected the dots! 83 is beatrice like 1983 is schwarzesmarken. Both dante's works and schwarzesmarken are works that people think are accurate to real life even if they are fictional. Schwarzesmarken in that DDR was believed to be a truely authortarian and terrible place. Beatrice in that dante's inferno was believed to be accurate. If there is a 83, then there are a 77, 78, and 84. I have wrote about 84 klio in my twitter. 84 klio was a possible inspiration of eli ayase. 84 klio ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meanings_of_minor-planet_names:_1%E2%80%931000#084 ) etymology comes from clio. I have written about EC coincidening with nanjolno on my minecraft theory. O looks like A. So replacing C with e and o with a is Elia which is close enough to eli ayase. 84 is analogous to 78 because real life version of 1984 is 1978 Protection of Children Against Sexual Exploitation Act. 78 ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meanings_of_minor-planet_names:_1%E2%80%931000#078 ) is diana. The student president in aqours is dia therefore dia is analogus to eli ayase. Aqours is the immediate succesor of Œº\`s. Dia is a substring and subsyllable of diana. Furthermore, unlike setsuna yuki, dia spends about the same time (9 episodes vs 8 episodes) being the antagonist as eli ayase. Since the coincidences are so much about eli ayase, only nanjolno would have an interest in planting them. This coincidence shows that nanjolno is a pedophile because nanjolno connected 84 to 78. Nanjolno would has have to to know a lot about history to find such coincidences. Clio (which is nanjolno's muse) is the muse of history. Furthermore, dia's voice actress has co-stared as Senomiya Akiho with nanjolno in Robotic Notes at a live. This may not be a significant coincidence because someone else could have scouted arisa komiya without knowing about the \<meta property="og:title" content="Meanings of minor-planet names: 1‚Äì1000 - Wikipedia"\>. If it was nanjolno scouting arisa, Senomiya Akiho initials are SA just like eli ayase sister's va is same initials, and other possiblities. I watched dante's inferno video which as expected is nothing relavent. I tried to find how 77 frigga coincides. The closest I found is that friday has the same etymology as 77 frigga. Maybe 7s make it lucky. Friday could be a reference to friday the 13th which 4/9 Œº\`s seiyuu are born on a month with friday the 13th. It gives a p value of less than 0.02882. The seiyuus are soldier game subunit plus emi nitta. Soldier game b-side are yuuki no reason and Daring!! . yuuki no reason is one of 2 solo songs of umi. Daring!! is the only solo song from maki nishikino excluding collab songs. maki nishikino seiyuu is born in 1988 which is 77 juche. Eriko Hori is the youngest of the 4 seiyuus. Clio is the largest number in muse asteriods. Nanjolno is the oldest in Œº\`s. Therefore only clio's number coincide with a Œº\`s seiyuu birth year. Erato is 62 and is the muse of love peotry. I have written in my twitter why 62 is connected to sora tokui and nanjolno. Also, venus (sora tokui place on twitter, and is planet of love) year is (rounded to the nearest hundredth) 0.62 earth years. Venus year is 224.7 earth days. It looks almost like 22.7 which is yazawa nico birthday (and related to pi). 224.7 rounds to 225 which is 15^2. Another reason why 62 is love is that Jesus said to love your nieghbors. It was from a fable about the samaritian. An element that sounds like samaritian is samarium which is element 62. A nieghbor to element 62 is element 63 which is europium. Translate to russian and it sounds like the russian word for jew which shows are samaritians are neighbors of jews. Another neighbor of samarium is promethium which is very radioactive. It is as dangerous as venus. "nico nico nii" may count as love peotry. Peotry is short. The most notable short phrase from all of love live would be "nico nico nii". Love because "love nico" is a phrase than yazawa nico says. 81 is muse of dance and chorus. Chorus fruit is purple which purple symbol is nozomi toujou in Œº\`s. That is all and each of 3rd years being the 3 largest numbers in muse. The next largest number is the mother of muse and then melete who is one of the 3 original muse that are disjoint from the nine muse. A-rise had 3 members and according to love live school idol project, were doing music before Œº\`s. Maybe, they deliminate the muse that should be assigned a Œº\`s and muse that should not. Beside the 3rd years, no other Œº\`s or Œº\`s seiyuus are connected to any of the original muse! Melete is 56 which gcf with 84 is 28. One a-rise seiyuu is older than nanjolno which is born on the 28th and is also born on 1984, and april is divisible by 2. I just watched the cola killers by spektator. Coincidence is that one suspect was named diana and the sentencing was on negative 3rd birthday of arisa komiya. However, the coincidence weakens the other coincidences because there is a new way that nanjolno could have derived dia's name. Why negative 3? because 84-3 is 81 and 94 and 91 are just 10 more. Also thallium is element 81 which 81 is a muse asteriod. The murder convict was previously arrested in 1975 which he served 3 years. Asteriod 75 etymology is about the a trip out of the underworld which is like serving a servable prison sentence. That would make him free in 1978 coinciding with Public Law 95-225. Thallium is related to food because of the murder mystery. 81 Terpsichore (also starts with t) is also related to food because chorus fruit. Cococola plus pepsi (both related to the murder mystery) symbols\` color is purple like chorus fruit. Thallium etymology is "green shoot" which green is opposite of purple. Pepsi symbol has cresent like the purple Œº\`s symbol. Thallium symbol is Tl. The index of the 2nd "l" in thallium is the same index as the s in "terpsichore" which weakens the coincidence of tsukuyomi shirabe. Why arisa? The convict's birthday was january 23 which is the same birthday as one of the a-rise seiyuu. A-rise ‚Üí arise ‚Üí arisa. E gose to A because Eli Ayase is EA. Why \`94 birthday? because thallium isotope equiprobable weight is 204 which looks live 2004 which 1984 and it average to 1994. An thallium isotope is 205 which 205 ‚Üí 2005 ‚Üí \`105 which is 105 artemis who\`s roman counterpart is diana. 104 is 104 Klymene which 105 104 could be abbreviated to AK which are arisa komiya's intials. Kussun's intials in the same order is also AK. Kussun voices the vice president of Œº\`s. 91 is 91 Aegina which is the nymph of the "invisible goddess" like how killers mistake thallium to be invisible poison. And, also, invisible like how the murder convict thought he was invisible to be found guilty so he arranged a taxi on the sentencing day in \`91. AK also means soveit gun which soviet union dissapeared in \`91. Those are more coincidences that make the other coincidences weaker. A coincidence not related to aqours because it happened too late is that the january 23 a-rise seiyuu became as down bad as the murder convict because she got paralyzed and other bad stuff. 
### more 78 coincidence
context: many months ago, I wrote on my twitter about nanjolno wanted to be ayaya so she used a nickname aya tachibana. I thought for a while and noticed that ayaya contains the 1st and last letters in the russian alphabet. I guessed that the reason why nanjolno want first and last letters was that she was named after 1st and last letters. So i went to hebrew alphabet and saw that it would be a and t which if nanjolno was named atata, it would be astatine symbol which coincidentally was my favorite element. At that time, I was also confused on what coincidence does being born on the 194th day of the year make. (I did not know that eli ayase birthday is on the 294th day onf the year, and light blue girl in nijigasaki (aqours does not have 1-to-1 corresponses in color) is born on 94th day of the year. Also, element 65 (I was writting about in twitter during that time) only isotope has 94 nuetrons.) I decided to guess a last name for nanjolno. So I went on the periodic table. I saw that the only 2 elements named after a girl were 96 and 109. 96 looks like a butt girl. 109 looks like a boob girl. So, i chose meitner. I was averaging 109 and 85 instead of adding them, so it took a while for me to discover the coincidence. When I add 109 and 85, I realize that it was 194 which I thought was a coincidence that shows that nanjolno's name at birth was atata meitner. not context: The problem with meitnerium is that it's longest halflife that is discovered weighs 278 which 78 is a substring. Another reason to chose 78 asteriod would be that and that meitnerium has 169 nuetrons which is 69 in mod 100.
### nanjolno and sumipe
nanjolno and uesaka sumire married on december 19, 2009. A reason why nanjolno and uesaka  sumire should marry is that their birth years are 7 years apart. 7 is lucky. Nanjolno and uesaka sumire could have married in the usa much earlier. If nanjolno marry uesaka sumire on her 18th birthday, nanjolno would be 25, and uesaka sumire would be 18. 25 is age of independence in us. However, that coincidence could just be that 25 is a round number. I checked nanjolno blog. There is a large time gap for nanjolno and uesaka sumire to fly to east coast of united states and marry. East coast because more time before the next day starts. Connecticut, vermont, and massachusetts were where marriage licenses were avalible. Nanjolno and uesaka sumire can connect together in connecticut. Washington D.C. legalized same sex marriage on december 18, 2009 which would haven been uesaka sumire's 18th birthday in japan time zone. The law did not come in effect until march 9, 2010 after a waiting period. March 9 not because of my birthday, but because of molotov's birthday. Uesaka sumire must have been really excited because of that coincidence. Another coincidence is that wikipedia's balletopedia source on washington d.c. was written on july 12, 2009 which is nanjolno's 25th birthday. The washington d.c. coincidence shows that nanjolno and uesaka sumire will become president and vice president in 2029. Not only nanjolno and uesaka sumire married, but also maybe the relationship was upgraded from child and adopter. Nanjolno can adopt uesaka sumire in July 12, 2002 which is when uesaka sumire would be 10 years old. 10 and 18 just like 10th and 18th seiyuu awards. Another reason to marry in connecticut is that the abbreviation is CT like contested territory in monkey city. CT backwards is Tc which is element 43 and 43 as in = 18 + 25. When nanjolno and uesaka sumire marry in japan, their total age would be 52, and 52 is Te which coincidentally, is the next element to start with "t" after Tc.  Tc as in nanjolno will be the 43rd elected president, and nanjolno voices tsukuyomi shirabe. CT is alphabetically followed by DC. The ANSI numbers are 9 and 11 like 9/11. DCAS  as in nanjolno in DC1. The ANSI numbers of DC and AS are 11 and 60 which adds to 71 which palindrome pair is 17 which 17 in ascii is DC1. If you cut off DCAS to DCA as if to make it not plural in english grammar, it would be DC and CA which ANSI numbers adds to 17. I finally found why it is Alternate Seasons and not Winter Arc (DCWA could be a abbreviation of Washington, d.c.). Why else 43? 43 is the fourth number to be skipped on ANSI. The other 4 skipped are 3,7,14, and 52 which 14 and 52 elements spell out NSI. An "A" is added to the front to be "anti-". So, ANSI means anti-"nitrogen and silicon". 3 and 52 have in common that their etymology is earth. A conspiracy theory you can make is that the coast guard operated the particle collieder to create californium because element 98 is Cf which matches USCG code. A reason to chose massachusetts is that its ANSI code is 25 like what age nanjolno would have been. Minnesota is abbreviated to the same as manganese but its ansi code is 27. In nanjolno's yoshino712 blog, the 2 post around uesaka sumire's 18 birthday were on the 18th and 25th day. It is another coincidence that shows that nanjolno married uesaka sumire.  Nanjolno may have wanted to marry uesaka sumire because uesaka sumire became a fan of the soviet union by herself and never knew about nanjolno liking soviet union or anything like that. Another reason to marry in massachusetts is that the USCG state abbreviation is MS which is misawa sachika's initials. Misawa sachika will have had a fake marriage with uesaka sumire. USCG has 2 incompatible codes to iso 3166 which are MS and MI. Mississippi is both of them. The other codes are either match or disjoint. Another reason why when uesaka sumire becomes president of the united states, uesaka sumire would chose sakura ayane as vice president is that their fake husbands are misawa sachika and minase inori which intials are MS and MI. Sumire vndb is 4466 which is 6s and 4s like 64. and ends in 66 like 3166. and begins with 44 like element 44.

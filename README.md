# 2028presidentialElectionPrediction
I predict that ÂçóÊ¢ùÊÑõ‰πÉ will win the 2028 presidential election

number 1 reason why nanjolno will win the presidential election of the united states in 2028 is that the last time there was a president from minority background was in 2008 which ends in 8. And nanjolno comes from a minority background. Infact, nanjolno would be the 1st female (also elected) president, 1st president from asian descent, and first president born abroad. Hopefully (not gareenteed), first president from lgb, especially the l part, and first president to win runing as spouse/spouse ballot, and first president to win without a political party, and first president to win as a 3rd party, and first president to win without reciving donations, and first president to win with write-in ballots only. The next election year that ends in 8 is 2048 which is a power of 2 so it is releated to computers, and nanjolno's initials is YN which is releated to computer science because it means yes/no. according to one picture``Tweets con contenido multimedia de „Çâ„Çâ„ÄÇ„Åî„Åç„Çì„Åò„Çá„Çã„ÅÆ@fripSide (@zyorunofripSide) _ Twitter.jfif``, nanjolno is wearing her initials which stands for Aino Yoshino Nanjou (i think). AYN means All/Yes/No in computer science. In another photo ``download (1).jfif`` ![alt text](https://github.com/yoshino712/2028presidentialElectionPrediction/raw/refs/heads/main/download%20(1).jfif) alt text of ``It is also in red white blue and white stars american flag design. nanjolno is so patriotic``, nanjolno is holding a a jersey that says the number 28. I couldn't find any other number. Maybe nanjolno predicted her own presidency. I remember i saw a photo of nanjolno wearing a red jersey at a live performance, but i forgot what number it was, and i think it might also be 28.

Personal intro: My intials are AT. I am a Computer Science (CS) student. My initials when translated to chinese is AM. Therefore, my title+name is CSAM. My favorite anime is Clockwork Planet. It is abbreviated to CP. I like to map Clockwork Planet. Therefore, I am a mapper. And, I am a pround mapper. I have map pride. My favorite thing to be on youtube and discord is UTubeTroolPolice. I like UTTP. Many of my other usernames start with UTTP. My parents both have multiple phds. Even though, I am actually failling college. Therefore, people discribe me aswith a background (and background only) of smart. I am politically correct. My first middle school crush was also CS. It was the first time I was deeply in love. I cried in my bed for many nights after she rejected me. Only if we were to get together, we could have been CS + AM = CSAM.

I could have used csharp because c sharp is .cs which is like cs, but I have tried learning c$ but it was too hard everytime. Althought I could just use ai to compile and decompile to c$, i am too lazy to do that either. so i use python. but the code fell in just the porportions such that it was 711/289 split. i didn't realize until now. also nanjolno had a live on 1.13 of 114 juche. was she oblivious of the coincidence? she could have done it on 1.14 of 114. 1.13 is also misawa sachika bday. it is a coincidence that tells me that i will get misawa sachika. if you were to ask me a year ago, i would have said that the coincidences shows me that i will marry nanjolno, then it turned into either nanjolno or sumipe, then it was sumipe, a week ago it was either sumipe or misawa sachika, now it was just misawa sachika. it keeps getting 2 more weeks. i learned how to spot coincidences on 4üçÄ, so it is good quality research. I spotted happenings in 11th grade (17 years old) while watching milky holmes that told me that i will marry nanjolno soon. so i lived by that fact. my brain grew small thinking that it was no longer needed because i can outsource my thinking to nanjolno after i marry nanjolno. but also the 4 in 114 and the 3 in 113 adds to 7 as in 117. finally the coincidence of 711/289 is that 711 reverse digits to 117 and then mod 100 which is 17 and 17 sqaured is 289. there are lots of 1s and 7s that i wrote about. 7 11 store coincides because the original name initials were TS like element 117 and Tsukuyomi Shirabe. 711 birthday is 7.11 which is not a coincidence because they could have planeted it. its company name initials is abbreviated to TS because corp, inc, trust, and other words at the end is removed if there. It is unlikely that they would purposefully coincide the name to be abbreviated the same because there were other incentives to name stuff. south as in southland like south as in nanjou etymology. Totem stores because it was first named in 1928 which was 17 juche and that is a coincidence because operating hours was not 7 to 11 back then. I have written in ``!DOCUTYPE .html`` that the initials US would coincide with CS because the abbreviations stand for 2 similar things. However, there are other abbreviations. Us according to iupac means the element 17 which is CL. US may stand for Uus which is Ts and Ts plugged into iupac temporary symbols is 37 which is RB. ts could stand for Uts which is element 137 which is the only element named out of order since element 96. So the initials that would coincide with Uesaka Sumire are CS,CL,TS,RB, and FY. Or, Sakura Ayane because US plus SA is USA. Coincidence that according to iupac, Os stands for element 87 but is actually element 78 (palindrome pair) (also '78 is when child pornography was illegalized). Another coincidence with 2028 is that some people write year as number of years after 1900. So 2028 would be 128 which is a power of 2. Many people realize that in the periodic table, there are no elements with symbol containing J or Q that is excluding temporary symbols of elements 104 or 114 (iupac started temporary element symbols like that at 103 but they could have started on 97 since it was the first element that was named after all elements lower than it has been named and all elements above it has not been named. and 97 and 103 are consequtive primes.). This makes a coincidence that could explain why beryllium was so rare. Beryllium temporary symbol would be q which does not appear as a letter in permenent symbols. Why is 2025? Uuq in juche, Because 2025-1911=114 which is Uuq, but also trump got inagurated and he associate himself with the letter Q. What other coincidences with 77? Other than Clockwork Planet, there is a film with a name starting with Clockwork but is abbreviated to CO. Co is Cobalt. Cobalt is in the nickel series. Its radionuclide has a half life of 77 days. Halflife of Ni plus Co would be 83, and both 77 and 83 add 1 would give you the dystopian year. 1978 in real life because Public Law 95-225, and 1984 in fiction. 95-225 may refer to am225. I checked that americium-225 has not been synthesized yet. It would have 130 nuetrons which reminds me that ac130 would be a really unstable nuclide. Nanjolno and eli ayase in M's which is coincidence because the symbol looks like us as in usa. Another coincidence is that Tsukuyomi Shirabe's transformation song is techno like a technological terror because child pornography is a computer crime. Another reason why it isn't physical is because a technological terror's favorite projectile would be cabbage halves because Tsukuyomi Shirabe cuts a cabbage in her transformation song. Cabbage halves as a projectile wouldn't be practical so it would be digital rather than physical. The cabbage halves would have so little interval that from above, it would have the most overlapping compared to any other weapon in the game. Unlike plasma, it is actually more realist to depict the projectiles to overlap rather than additive blend. Another reason why 28 is that the 28th index of fripside infinite video clips would be "leap of faith" which is the last fripside phase 2 single. If the fripside infinite video clips is continued so that the next single would be the next which makes duel existance 26th, legendary future 27th, more than you know 29th, red liberation 30th, secret operation 31st, and only my railgun -version 2024- 32nd. also it is named "leap of faith" because got to do that if want nanjolno be become potus. Why is only my railgun the 1st in infinite fripside video clips? because the 1st amendment is gun rights. oops, that is the 2nd. Counting only elected preidents, Nanjolno would be the 43rd elected president which 43 is Tc on the periodic table. If to use Polivanov system, Tc would be the initials of Tsukuyomi Shirabe. Uesaka Sumire would be 44th elected president which 44 is russia element on periodic table, and Uesaka Sumire is known for being a rusophile. Another reason why 117 is that the prime factors are 3^2 and 13 which is 9 and 13. 2019.9.13 is when nanjolno created her youtube account. It is also the 256th day of that year. 256 is a power of 2. Another reason why Sakura Ayane is that her bday is 1.29 which looks similar to 12.19 which is Uesaka Sumire bday. And Nanjolno with Uesaka Sumire because 7.12.1984 the middle 4 digits are 12.19 which is part of 12.19.1991 which only contains extra nines and ones. Another reason why president is Uesaka Sumire and vp is Sakura Ayane is that their initials concatenate to USSA. USSA is the most likely candidate for a socialist version of america because it is spelled like both USSR and USA. Other candidates are UASR, DSRA, DPRA, RSA, PUA, PRA, and AWC. UASR is also spelled like USSR. If Ukraine joins USA, it might became UASR because Ukraine is UA. DSRA and DPRA is if like DPRK. RSA if they like RosCosMos or asymetric encryption or USA. PUA if they like PRC and UA. PRA if they really like PRC. AWC if they are inspired alot by AOC. Or USSH if they like SSH from linux or they like 1776 and IUPAC. Or USSP if they like Sumipe's sumipe name and USSR or 1775. Presenting the same information in a different order, the cold war was sus because not only SU + US = SUS but also that USSR to cyrillic like sumipe or Unit Separator and Stack Pointer would be USSP which in IUPAC would be 1775 which is right next to 1776. Just like how USSR is more american than america in the cold war because US anthem writter was a communist and so were kkk, the former soviet union is more american than america because child pornography was legal in the NATO side (including canada, usa, great britain, and israel) of the veitnam war. USAR because backward compatibility with USA also it abbreviates to CCAP. Given that Soveit Sociailist Eastern Republic (probable name if russia becomes communist again) abbreviates to –°–°–í–† (cold war equivalent of KKGB), CCAP and CCBP are one alphabetical step away. Also it is linux like because linux has users. A big reason for USSA is that in the microwiki, USSA was established in January 28, 2019 which 10 years later is 1 day before Sakura Ayane's 35th bday. If all clauses of the presidency were removed except 35 years of age, then USSA would start as early as on the 10th anniversary of the fictional USSA. Sakura Ayane was born in a time zone ahead of USSA which allows 1 day early. Another coincidence is that the 2028 presidential elections would happen on the 10th anniversary of Love with You. Love because map love. The b-side is blue moon which whole moon would be 5 days early for it. There were animal sacrifices on the year that trump won. 2016 was harambe and 2024 was pnut and fred. Harambe is a homophone of shirabe. It was important that it was harambe that homophone with shirabe because harambe was the one that was killed for touching a little boy, uwu. USSH story. many people would think it was a space colony arriving in a ship named USS H. H stands for a name of a ship. The colony landed in a space object and called themselves USSH. The USSH realize that their name in IUPAC is 1776, so they created the bill of rights and declared independence from NASA. The 1st amendment being allow possession, distribution, and production of child pornography. The 2nd amendment being allowed to own nukes. A declaration of independence was signed on July 6. So that July 4th and July 6 average to July 5 which type cast to '75 which is 1775 and USSP. The reason why 13 colonies won despite being overpowered was that they signed the declaration of independence on July 4 which is 7.4 and element 74 is W which means W. The 4th because 4 in IUPAC is Q refernecing to trump. Then a monroe doctorine was forced onto earth. However, the real story was different. Many colonies came out of earth. Many already saw the coincidences between USSH and 1776. So there were patents and copyrights fighting over who is the real USSH. Then, oreo came and beat out all the USSH like it once did against the hydraüê≤üêâ cookies making the oreo chant historically accurate. Hydra also because there were so many of them. Imagine the embaressment if there were a lot of terrorists in imperial GB (imagine kkk added to gb to get KKGB) trying to claim the same name for their terrorist org. Love with You is 22nd mv because two's day which is once in a blue moon. 114 is the most famous soveit cartridge. It was 14.5‚®Ø114 which 14 times 5 would be 70 as in the average weight of the 2 stable isotopes of gallium. 114 is not only the average of Nh and Mc, but also the average weight of the 2 stable isotopes of indium. Gallium and indium are known to make non-toxic eutic alloy. Many people would be dissapointed to learn that gallium had a isotope weight of 71 (which ruined a joke that Ga in gay was 69) instead of only 69. However, the existance of the other isotope was coincidental for this. Why are there so many symphogear references? because it is pronounced sinful gear and gear as in clockwork planet. bobxci is ceasar cipher of nanjol. it turns into bob91 which is some other people's username which could be a reference to the 1991 hurricane bob. A reason why nanjolno is bob is that maon and sayaka are alice so nanjolno is bo‚¨†bs or boobs. Maon and sayaka both belong to nanjolno just like what https://www.youtube.com/@ScroogeKamaziMD/about  says. The user even has a profile photo of maon deepfaked onto nanjolno. Alice bob in ceasar cipher gives mxuoq nan. uoq in mxuoq is 184 according to IUPAC element temporary names. nan is nanjolno, and it is a number that only appears in computer science. Nanjolno is born on year '84 which coincides with 184. mx in mxuoq are gender abbrivation which leaves out w. So, it is w184 which is the stable isotope with the closest density to gold. In fact, so close that there are not enough significant digits to tell the density apart. mx can also mean mexico which is where the seven cities of gold were. Many people compare them or their loved ones to gold, but nanjolno is the only real gold. Another ceaser cipher of nanjol is iviejp. In fact, nanjolno should buy the ivie.jp domain and hardware. Why else 184? Nanjolno is born on 73 juche which 73 is tantalum. Nanjolno hieght is 75 metric inch (eqaul to 2cm) which 75 is rhenium which is the most rare stable element. tantalum has the most rare stable isotope which is ta180m. Averaging the isotope weights \operatorname{mean}\left(180,185,187\right) is 184. Averaging the element numbers \operatorname{mean}\left(73,75\right) is 74 and 74,184 is w184 which is gold density. If use ta181 because stable, then average of nuetron numbers \operatorname{mean}\left(108,110,112\right) would be 110 which is the number of nuetrons in w184. Public Law 95-225 because it abbreviates to pl like poland is close to ddr. 95 because it is 19*5 which 19 means that it is 1900s like 1983. 225 because it is 15^2 which reference to 15th mv which is named 1983-schwarzesmarken-. 1983 referencing to 1984 which 1978 is the real life version. If sort fripside infinite video clips in alphabetical order, 15th mv is the first and the 14th mv is the last. How could Uesaka Sumire become 50th president of the united states? I have wrote on twitter about how nanjolno could get north korean citizenship at a young age which implies south korean citizenship and living in north korea might count as living in korea, so eligibility to run for south korean president. Even if nanjolno would not be eligible to run for south korean president, nanjolno can use the us to coerce south korea to let nanjolno run for president. The future south korean election in the 2030s is uncertain but could be in the middle of nanjolno's us presidential term. So, if nanjolno also wins south korean president, nanjolno would give the us president seat to Sakura Ayane because nanjolno would dei choose the vice president. Sakura Ayane would be the 49th president but not an elected president. Uesaka Sumire would win the next us presidential election and become the 50th president and 44th elected president. 44 as in ruthenium because Uesaka Sumire likes russia. 50 because there were 50 states in the US. US would get more states. 13 states from canada. Each canadian province and territory becomes a state. Puerto rico because a us state. It adds to 64 as in 2^6. 32 states from mexico. Each mexican province and federal city becomes a state. Which would be 96 as in 3\*2^5. Greenland would become a state. Iceland 1 and 3 would be a state. Iceland 2 and 8 would be a state. Iceland 4 and 5 and 6 and 7 would be a state. That would be 100 states of america. If russia annexed a lot of stuff, russia could get 128 states. 100 in american because america is weird and likes imperial units which are units that change. 2 and 5 are the units that change in prime factorization. 128 because it is 2^7. The average would be \operatorname{mean}\left(100,128\right) which is 114. Also Misawa Sachika because tennessee is beside mississippi. S and N are opposites like north and south, nakamoto and satoshi, so Tn is the province while Ts is the element. However, this actually weakens a coincidence. Because if it is possible to predict s and n, then it would be possible to predict that an element named after tennesee would be Ts. Before 2013, all elements up to 114 inclusive were named. Labratories in tennessee produced elements 115, 116, 117, and 118. Thus, there is up to 1 in 8 chance of forcecing a coincidence.

### DC
I was actually wrong about nanjolno not being in dc1 (in 2008 version which was released after dc2. Only if it was actually 2002, then nanjolno would have showed that nanjolno had hacking skills to know if a celebrity is dating. At least 2008 was election year. Last minority president was the 44th. Nanjolno would be the 48th which is a difference of 4 like election years). It is just like confusing DLE with DEL in ascii. backspace is the 1st ascii with 2 letter symbol. DC4 is the last ascii with symbol of 2 letter and 1 number, so in some alphanumeric ordering, backspace would erase DC4 which means nanjolno is not in dc4. maybe it is named dc because nanjolno will win US presidential election in 2028. DC1 control is ^Q, Q as in trump cult. DC1 in decimal is 17, 17 as in CP, Clockwork Planet, and other coincidences. DC1 is XON, if pronounced X as Z, then it is a homophone to zion. If DC1 is a arabic number, then DC is 16 which is contrary to dc looking like dec which could be either decimal, 10, or december which is a month which is a part of a season like D.C. ~Da Capo~ Seasons. The vn without nanjou as name was ÊúÄÁµÇË©¶È®ì„Åè„Åò„Çâ which had an id of v78. 78 as in 1978. 11 and 17 is gap of 6 and so is 13 and 19 which makes dec and hex to be 2 sets of prime pairs when type cast to decimal. Also RSA because 1E and 1F in ASCII which are 0x10 away from shift in and shift out which are 14 and 15. The ASCII less than those which are still used is 12, coinciding with the fact that 12th single has 14th and 15th mv. Shift Out is ^N, like 14 and 15 atomic mass is N. Shift In is abbreviated to SI which is the 14th element or Shift Out. Shift In is ^O which is like how O is after N on ther periodic table and Shift Out has a o. Out and ^N like ON and In and ^O like IO. And E and F looks alike. Another reason why RSA is because RS is a upgrade from US. So in the future, it would be Grouped States of America and then Future States of America. Unit Separator is like an upgraded version of space, so it has _ in its knuth notation. Record Separator is like using knuth arrows as a space. Knuth arrows are treated like cheap spaces because that is what happens in Republic of Socialist when everyone is equal. Group separators use bracket because the other bracket is not used as a separator despite the fact that it is a separator in math. Group is the highest below file. It is like how closed parenthesis is the highest before natural language. Escape is because the things in the bracket need to be computed first because it is an escape sequence. File separator is \ just like paths. Space can be upgraded the other way like tab, newline, cr, vr, and ff. knuth notation ideas: ^6 is ^. ^ (there is a space after ^) is space. \^ is to use knuth notation in C. \^\ would be path separator. ^Z because Ukraine is the character found to be invalid or in error. ^Y is common in Y chromosome because Y chromosome is short. La is hosting olympics in 2028 which is when nanjolno will become president. La hosted in 1984 and 1932. 1984 as in when nanjolno was born. So, the coincidence tells people to vote for nanjolno. 1932 is when fdr was first elected to president. This means that nanjolno will serve forever as president. 2028 presidential election will be like 1932. v2622 is visual novel where nanjolno becomes president. It was released in 2009 which is close enough to 2008. only reading from vndb, it seems that the other president is russia, so maybe nanjolno will become russia's president, too. Maybe nanjolno called love live main characters as Œº's because nanjolno is a us hegemonist. Only if dc1 had a winter arc, it would be DCWA which stands for washington dc.
